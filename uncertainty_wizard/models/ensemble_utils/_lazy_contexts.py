        Override this method to specify the amount of MB which should be used
        when creating the virtual device on the GPU. Ignored for CPUs.

        *Attention:* This function must be pure: Repeated calls should always return the same value.

        :return: The amount of MB which will be reserved on the selected gpu in the created context.
