    """
    LazyEnsembles are uncertainty wizards implementation of Deep Ensembles,
    where multiple atomic models are trained for the same problem;
    the output distribution (and thus uncertainty) is then inferred from predicting on all atomic models.

    ** Multi-Processing **

    This ensemble implementation is lazy as it does not keep the atomic models in memory
    (or even worse, in the tf graph).
    Instead, atomic models are persisted on the file system and only loaded when needed -
    and discarded immediately afterwards.
    To further increase performance, in particular on high performance GPU powered hardware setups,
    where a single model instance training does not use the full GPU resources,
    LazyEnsemble allows to create multiple concurrent tensorflow sessions, each running a dedicated model in parallel.
    The number of processes to be used can be specified on essentially any LazyEnsemble function.


    Models are loaded into a context, e.g. a gpu configuration which was configured before the model was loaded.
    The default context, if multiple processes are used, sets the GPU usage to dynamic memory growth.
    Pay attention: By using too many processes, it is easy to exhaust your systems resources.
    Thus, we recommend to set the number of processes conservatively, observe the system load
    and increase the number of processes if possible.
    Default contexts are uwiz.models.ensemble_utils.DynamicGpuGrowthContextManager if multiprocessing is enables,
    and uwiz.models.ensemble_utils.NoneContextManager otherwise.

    Note: Multi-Processing can be disabled by setting the number of processes to 0.
    Then, predictions will be made in the main process on the main tensorflow session.
    *Attention*: In this case, the tensorflow session will be cleared after every model execution!

    ** The LazyEnsemble Interface & Workflow **

    LazyEnsemble exposes four central functions: create, modify and consume.
    In general, every of these functions expectes a picklable function at input
    which either creates, modifies or consumes a plain keras model.
    Please refer to the specific methods documentation for details.
    Furthermore LazyEnsemble exposes utility methods wrapping the above listed methods,
    e.g. fit and predict_quantified, which expect numpy array inputs and automatically
    serialize and deserialize them to be used in parallel processes.

    ** Stability of Lazy Ensembles **

    To optimize GPU use, LazyEnsemble relies on some of tensorflows experimental features and is thus,
    by extension, also to be considered experimental.
