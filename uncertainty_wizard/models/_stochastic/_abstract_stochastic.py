    Stochastic models are models in which some randomness is added to the network during training.
    While this is typically done for network regularization, models trained in such a way can be used for
    uncertainty quantification. Simply speaking:

    Randomness (which is typically disabled during inference) can be enforced during inference,
    leading to predictions which are impacted by the random noise.
    By sampling multiple network outputs for the same input, we can infer the robustness of the network to the
    random noise. We assume that the higher the robustness, the higher the networks confidence.

    Instances of stochastic uncertainty wizard models can also be used in a non-stochastic way
    as as point prediction models (i.e., models without sampling)
    by calling the `model.predict` function
    or by passing a quantifier which does not rely on sampling to `model.predict_quantified` (such as Max-Softmax).
    Randomization during model inference is automatically enabled or disabled.
